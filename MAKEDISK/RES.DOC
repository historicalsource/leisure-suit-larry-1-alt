							RES
			  The AGI volume/disk resolution program

Res.exe is a program written in Borland's Turbo Prolog which can be used
to help resolve the distribution of objects between the various disks
of an adventure game.

Before running RES, the following files should be available in your DOS
search path

	res.bat
	r.exe
	finduse.exe
	mkvol.exe
	size.bat
	use.bat

The macro 'size.cm' should be in your Brief directory, and the file
'prolog.err' should be in your makedisk directory (just in case RES
bombs and wants to display an error message).

The RES program and its supporting files assume the canonical sub-directory
structure for adventure games:

				main game directory
					    |
	 -----------------------------------------------------
	 |		 |		 |		 |		 |		   |
	src		lgc		view		pic		snd		makedisk



Create the three auxiliary files in the following manner (the files
may contain blank lines, and comments are preceeded with semi-colons):

disks
	This file tells RES how many disks and volumes you are going to make
	and which volumes are on which disks.  There should be one line of
	the form
		nvols(v)		;v = maximum volume number
	and one of the form
		ndisks(d)		;d = number of disks
	
	The remainder of the file consists of as many lines as necessary
	to represent the disk/volume relationships.  These lines are
	of the form
		ondisk(d,v)	;d = disk number, v = volume number

uses
	This file tells RES the objects which each room requires.  You
	create the file by running the 'use.bat' batch file.

sizes
	This file tells RES the sizes of the various objects in the game.
	Create it by running the 'size.bat' batch file, then loading
	the resulting file named 'sizes' into Brief, running the 'size'
	macro, and saving the file.  (Note that this requires a relatively
	new version of 'ls'.)



The next thing to do is create preliminary driver files for mkvol.  These
files are named 'VOLn.DRV' where 'n' is the volume number.  The files
(which may contain blank lines and comments preceed with a semi-colon)
consist of the indications of which files to be included in the volume.
Room number XX is represented by
			rXX
picture Z by
			pZ
view YYY by
			vYYY
and sound N by
			sN
[Sorry about the change from the former volume files -- RES is a very memory
hungry program, and the smaller the representation of the objects, the better
(and faster) it is.]


RES uses the Turbo Prolog editor internally, and reads characters for
this through DOS calls.  Thus, if you have the ANSI.SYS device driver
installed and have re-assigned some keys on the keyboard, you should
undefine these keys before running RES, then redefine them on exit.  This
is done in the res.bat file by TYPEing the file 'undefn' to undefine
the keys, then running RES ('r'), and finally TYPEing 'keydefns' to
redefine the keys after leaving RES.  Delete these lines if you haven't
done any key definitions in DOS.  Otherwise, create both 'undefn' and
'keydefns'.



Now you're ready to run RES.  Make sure that you don't have any incarnations
of Brief tying up memory, as RES needs all it can get.  Then type 'res'.
You'll see the three RES windows appear, then a window showing the
initialization taking place.  This will take a while -- be patient, you're
machine isn't dead (see the hard-disk light blinking every now and then?).
If RES is unable to initialize itself, an error message will be displayed.
Once initialization has completed, the RES menu will be displayed.
Menu selections are made by pressing the first letter of the item desired.
The selections are:

Resolve
	This prompts for a disk number, then tries to 'resolve' the given
	disk.  Any files needed by logics on the given disk, but not present
	on the disk will be displayed in the 'Missing' window, along with
	any duplication of objects between volumes.  This may take a while --
	if you've got a turbo machine, make sure it is in turbo mode.

Driver
	This prompts for a volume number, then loads the corresponding volume
	driver into the 'Driver' window and allows you to edit it.  The editing
	keys are those of Turbo Prolog (similar to WordStar) -- a cheat sheet
	is available.  To return to the menu, type ESC.  You will be prompted
	for a file name to save under.  Type in a new name if you wish, or press
	ENTER to save under the current name or	ESC to not save it.

Missing
	This prompts for a volume number (which you must have, at some time,
	run Resolve on) and allows you to edit the 'missing' file for that
	volume in the 'Missing' window.

Sizes
	This computes the space occupied by the volumes on each of the disks
	and displays the results in the 'Disk Sizes' window.

Edit
	This prompts for a file name and allows you to edit that file
	in a special window.  To expand that window to full screen, press
	Ctrl-F10.  Press ESC when you're done and deal with the filename
	as in 'Driver' above.

OS
	Operating System -- exit to a secondary command processer (if there
	is enough memory).

Quit
	Quit.



After running RES, you will also have several files hanging around in your
makedisk directory which may prove useful -- the files MISSING.n contain
the information from the 'Missing' window for each of the the disks, and
the file DISKSIZE contains the disk sizes.  The DISKLIST.n files aren't
all that useful -- they are just lists of what is on each disk.
