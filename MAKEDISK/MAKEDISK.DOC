				 ============================




SECTION I. PRELIMINARY STUFF.  

DO THIS IF NO ONE HAS EVER MADE THIS GAME BEFORE:
(Al has done this so please skip to section II.)


	1.	make "vol?.drv" for each disk, plus "vol0.drv", listing the rooms 
		on each volume.
	
	2.	run "finduse rm.*>..\makedisk\uses"
	
	3.	edit vol?.drv and run the macro "complete".
	
	4.	manually resolve all loads from var's in vol?.drv.
	
	5.	run "chkdupes" on "vol0" vs. all "vol?".
		run "chkdupes" on "vol?" vs. all "vol?".
	
	6.	edit "dupes", moving the dupes from vol? and vol? to vol0.
	
	7.	run "resolve".
	
	8.	edit "missing", and resolve the differences in vol?.
	
	9.	run "makevol"
	
	10.	check volume sizes.  Go back to #1 until right.
	



SECTION II.  MAINTENANCE

ONCE ALL THE ABOVE STUFF IS FINISHED.
(start here!)

	1. 	find out from wherever you can (QA, various Bobs, actually play
		testing the game) what stuff is missing from where.

	2. 	edit the vol?.drv file for that particular volume, and add the 
		missing items in the appropriate places.

	3.	run the "makeall" batch file.  It requires 3 formatted disks,
		that will be erased clean in the process.
		
			NOTE:  You MUST go into the \kq\makedisk directory 
			manually to use any of these files, since they are 
			all pretty drastic.  They are purposefully NOT in 
			your DOS "path".  



MAKEDISK
The "makedisk" batch file should be run if there have been no changes to 
the "vol" files since your last "makeall."  "What good is this?" you may ask.  Good question.
If you are making several copies of your game disks for distribution, it IS 
faster than using "diskcopy" -- that's about it.


MAKESHIP
This "makeship" batch file should be run after "makeall" if production
copies for the FormMaster are needed.  It requires the special
"made-by-Jeff" floppy, copies it to KQ3 Disk 1, then copies the necessary
files to all 3 KQ3 disks.
