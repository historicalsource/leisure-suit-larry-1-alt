                                DEBUG COMMANDS
                                ==============

                            as of:  May 19, 1987




THE DEBUG MENU:
---------------

You can't type these in; they're all in the debug menu.
Most have some ALT key equivalent.


Ego Info            ALT-E     tells current ego info, as in the 
                              "Obj Info" command below.          (formerly F4)

Priority Screen     ALT-P     shows the priority screen.         (formerly F6)

Memory              ALT-M     shows present memory usage.        (formerly F8)

Obj info            ALT-I     prompts for animated object number, then
                              gives its location, size, priority, etc.
                              Note:  I normally number objects in a room from 
                              1 up, and objects that occur in several rooms 
                              from 15 down.  These numbers will be gladly 
                              disclosed upon request.

X/Y Display                   same as typing "xy" (see below)

Get All Inventory             the lazy way to "find" every object in the game

Inventory Numbers             helps you do a "get object" (see below) by
                              telling the numbers of all the objects.




TYPED DEBUG COMMANDS:
---------------------

These must be typed in, and the "debugging" flag must be set.  If you get a
"How can you do that?" response, hit ALT-D to turn "debugging" on.


"show position" OR 
"room number" OR 
"room" OR 
"xy"                all do the same thing:  turn on & off the display at the
                    bottom of the screen that shows ego's x/y and the
                    current room number 


alt-Z               quits quickly, and returns you to DOS

"where" OR
ALT-E               same as "Ego Info" on the debug menu; shows ego's
                    location, height, width, and priority

"tp"                skip immediately to a new room; 

"position"          lets you immediately reposition ego to a different x/y 
                    (useful to quickly see if old bugs have been fixed)

"show priority" OR
ALT-P               shows the priority screen

"get object"        asks for the inventory object's number, then gives 
                    it to you

"gimme gimme"		same as "get all inventory" menu item

"object in room"    asks you for an inventory object's number, then
                    tells you the current room that object is in.

"set priority"      lets you change ego's priority; it remains that until
                    you "release priority" (see below), or enter a new room
                    If ego's really messed up, try setting his priority to 15
                    for a while.

"release priority"  sets ego's priority back to what it usually should be


"show flag"         asks for a flag number, then tells you whether that flag
                    is set, or not set ("not set" is sometimes called "clear")

"set flag"          asks for a flag number, then sets that flag

"reset flag"        asks for a flag number, then resets (clears) that flag

"show var"          asks for a var number, then tells you that var's value

"set var"           asks for a var number, then asks for a new value, 
                    then makes that var's value equal the new value




OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS:
-----------------------

If you are hung up, or can't move, or can't type, hit ALT-D to turn 
"debugging" off, then ALT-D again to turn it on.  This will turn off 
programControl, preventInput, etc. and reestablish you as "the boss" again. 
(This also gives the only "true" VERSION NUMBER of this particular game
disk.)


The brown "H" at the bottom of the screen tells you that the "handsOff" flag
is set.  This may not mean much to you, but please mention in your bug report
if that "H" IS displayed.
