The main-speaker slot
in the meeting schedule is 30-40 minutes long. We also have "sideshows" -- well, they set up along the side of
the meeting hall and show products.  I think you may find that a lot of
"serious computer users" have no idea how classy games have become.  

Phil Smith, Program Director, (415) 566-3648.  
The two "where & how long"s are 1) main
speaker time, about 40 minutes, in front of everybody, 2) "sideshow" time,
along the side of the hall before and after main part of the meeting.

Unless the world shakes itself and belches forth an EGA projection
monitor, you might be better off in the "sideshow" mode.  It's also a lot
quicker to fit in that way -- Phil has main speaker lined up thru the Fall,
but there can be several sideshows.
